# COMP2068-Assignment1
My repository for Assignment 1 in COMP2068 (Advanced Web Programming).

This is my repository for my COMP2068 Assignment 1, an online portfolio built with Express JS and hosted on Azure.

I will be using this README to track my own progress on the assignment, by listing a summary of work done on different dates.
